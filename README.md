# VideoAnnotationTool
This tool allows the user to make annotations on any frame in a video file.

Both the figure and the code file must be downloaded to use the tool. The code file is the file that must be used to actually run the tool.

The toolbar at the top allows the user to zoom in/out as well as move around the image.

The "Load" button in the top right allows a user to load a given video.

The "Save" button in the middle right must be used to save annotations, if a new fram is chosen before the annotations are saved, the annotations will be lost.

The "Annotate" button at the top right creates a pen tool so the user can make an annotation. Just right-click to finish each annotation.

The "Clear" button under the "Annotate" button will clear all annotations for a selected frame as well as delete any associated files.

The number of frames is displayed in the bottom left.

The current frame is displayed in the bottom right. The current frame can be changed by either using the slider at the bottom, or by entering the desired frame in the text field in the bottom right and pressing the "Update" button.

It is best to have each video file in a separate folder as the annotations will be saved in the same folder as the video file.
